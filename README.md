Project Title:
HandsMen Threads: Elevating the Art of Sophistication in Men's Fashion

Organization Overview:
HandsMen Threads is a progressive fashion enterprise focused on sophistication in men’s fashion. As part of their digital transformation, they launched a Salesforce project to streamline internal operations, enhance customer relationships, and ensure high data fidelity across systems.

Project Objectives:
Design a robust, scalable Salesforce data model.

Ensure data integrity through UI-based validations.

Automate key business workflows to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Empower the business with real-time insights and scalable automation.

Key Use Cases Implemented:
1. Automated Order Confirmations
After an order is placed, the customer receives an automatic confirmation email using a standard Email Template and Flow.

Enhances transparency and customer engagement.

2. Dynamic Loyalty Program
Purchase history tracked using Custom Fields and logic in Flows and Apex classes.

Customer status auto-updated, triggering personalized rewards.

3. Proactive Stock Alerts
When inventory drops below five units, a scheduled Flow sends an automatic email to the warehouse team.

Prevents stockouts and improves inventory turnover.

A Batch Apex Job runs nightly to process bulk orders.

Updates inventory, financial records, and generates a summary report.
